## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Enter input and press the button
- See converted units
- See singular and plural versions of units depending on input
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/cqtGul0V8RFXY4vTcIv1Kc/Unit-Conversion?node-id=0%3A1) - For styles


### What I learned

With this app I practiced JS functions with the use of conditionals. I got more experience manipulating the DOM and rendering text depending on user input. I used string interpolation and ternary operator.



```js
const kg = (num / 2.204).toFixed(3)
}
```
```js
`${num} ${num == 1 ? "meter" : "meters"} = ${feet}`
}
```


### Continued development

I am planning to continue focusing on writing JavaScript functions and start designing more complex applications.
